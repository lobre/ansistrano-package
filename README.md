# Ansistrano Package Role

This ansible role has been created in complement of Ansistrano deploy scripts.
You can find them here: [Ansistrano](https://github.com/ansistrano)

This role creates a package locally from a git repository. Then, this package will be uploaded with Ansistrano deploy role and its rsync strategy.

It has been created because the remote server has not always access to the git repository. So for this case, the git repository is hit from the local machine. The package is then created and arranged locally.

The variables are fully compatible with Ansistrano variables.

## Installation

In order to install Ansistrano package, deploy and rollback roles you can create a `requirements.yml` file for instance.

    # requirements.yml
    - src: carlosbuenosvinos.ansistrano-deploy
    - src: carlosbuenosvinos.ansistrano-rollback
    - src: https://github.com/loric-/ansistrano-package.git

And then install it with.

    $ ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml

## Update

If you want to update the role, you need to pass --force parameter when installing. Please, check the following command.

    $ ansible-galaxy install --force -p roles -r requirements.yml
